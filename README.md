# Community Traits Ported (OpenMW)

Select your character's background that will shape his future.

This mod adds a new chargen options alongside the existing ones: your character's background, belief, lineage and culture. All of them can range from simple stat changes to scripted events that completely alter the way you play the game.

Builtin traits include (with minor changes for the sake of balance):

- [Merlord's Character Backgrounds](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46795) by Merlord
- [mtrByTheDivines](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48031) by MTR
- [mtrLineage](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49996) by MTR
- [mtrCultures](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51282) by MTR

To give you a general idea, Character Backrounds tend to be more scripted, while MTR's traits are mostly stat changes and abilities. Also, they all are optional.

> Note: Any expansions created for the MWSE version of Character Backgrounds are not compatible with this mod and must be adapted to the OpenMW Lua API.

## Adding your own Traits

New traits are created in player scripts using `I.CharacterTraitsFramework.addTrait()`. New trait types are registered automatically based on their `type` field.

Example:

```lua
local I = require("openmw.interfaces")
local self = require("openmw.self")
local ui = require("openmw.ui")

I.CharacterTraits.addTrait {
    id = "test",
    type = "background",
    name = "Test Background",
    description = "This background does this, this, and that.",

    doOnce = function()
        -- Called only once when the trait is activated
        local strength = self.type.stats.attributes.strength(self)
        strength.base = strength.base + 15
    end,

    callback = function(data)
        -- Called when the trait is activated and during script initialization
        ui.showMessage("Test background successfully initialized!")
    end
}
```

## Installation

### Requirements

- [Stats Window Extender (OpenMW)](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/57727) by Ralts

### Load Order

All trait modules need to be loaded after the `CharacterTraitsFramework.lua`. For example:

- CharacterTraitsFramework.lua
- CharacterTraits_Backgrounds.omwaddon
- CharacterTraits_Backgrounds.omwscripts
- CharacterTraits_Beliefs.omwaddon
- CharacterTraits_Beliefs.omwscripts
- ...

## Compatibility

Compatible with any mods.

Safe to install or update mid-playthrough. Removing the mod, though, might not revert all effects of the picked traits.

### Soft Incompatibilities

Nothing gamebreaking, just a little whacky behavior.

- [OpenMW Daggerfall Character Creation](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/58464) by Slowchu - After chargen both UIs fire at the same time and one will temporarily cover the other
